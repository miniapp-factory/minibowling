#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### recommends marketing strategies and channels.  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new todo file that describes the logo image you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a bold, modern icon that represents marketing strategies and channels. The icon should combine a megaphone and a network node diagram, with vibrant colors such as electric blue, lime green, and orange. The background should be a clean white gradient that fades from light gray at the top to pure white at the bottom. The overall composition should be balanced and centered, conveying innovation and connectivity.
